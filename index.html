                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Growing up in a difficult family situation, I discovered my passion for design early on. I taught myself how to use design software like Photoshop and took on various design projects, from logo design to flyers and other print materials. Despite the challenges I faced, I never gave up on my dream of pursuing a career in design.</p>
                <p>One day, I met a friend who introduced me to the world of website design. My first project was managing a website for an online course creator. As I continued to work on web design projects, I discovered my true passion: UI/UX Design.</p>
                <p>Through self-study and determination, I honed my skills and gained the confidence to become more than just a designer. I became an entrepreneurial creative, using my design skills to help business owners improve their online presence. My goal is to turn a cluttered and confusing website or app into a user-friendly and well-organized platform that provides a smooth navigation experience for users.</p>
                <p>This path was not easy, but it was worth it, as I found my calling in UI/UX design. I hope to continue to help businesses improve their online presence and achieve their goals.</p>
